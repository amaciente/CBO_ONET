# CBO_ONET_correspondence
Correspondence between Brazilian and US occupational classifications

This project is conducted by Aguinaldo N Maciente and aims at making available an up-to-date correspondence between the Brazilian and the US occupational classifications. Originally, I will post the correspondence between CBO2002, the Brazilian occupation classification used for administrative data, and the American O\*NET-SOC classification. In the future I plan to add correspondences between O\*NET-SOC and Brazil's alternative classification, COD-2010, which is based on ISCO-2008 and used at IBGE's survey data, such as the Population Census and PNAD (Brazil's household survey).
