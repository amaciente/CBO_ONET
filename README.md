# CBO_ONET_correspondence
Correspondence between Brazilian and US occupational classifications

This project is conducted by Aguinaldo N Maciente and aims at making available an up-to-date correspondence between the Brazilian and the US official occupational classifications. Originally, I will post the correspondence between CBO2002, the Brazilian occupation classification used for administrative data, and the American O*NET-SOC classification. In the future I plan to add correspondences between O*NET-SOC and Brazil's alternative classification COD-2010, based on ISCO-2008, which is used by IBGE survey data, such as the Population Census and PNAD (Brazil's household survey).
